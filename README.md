**PRISON GERRYMANDERING MAP**


## Elevator Pitch

This app will show people the true extent to which prison gerrymandering impacts the apportioning of political power in the United States. I'm hoping that by allowing for a map-based understanding of how much of a difference this makes, that individuals can advocate for counting incarcerated individuals in their home locality rather than where they are incarcerated, or not accounting for them at all.

Some states, including New York and Maryland, have ended prison gerrymandering in state legislature and local governance.
In Colorado, Missisippi, Virginia and New Jersey, there is some acknowledgement of the impact prison populations have on school districts, but no enforced law for ending prison gerrymandering in state legislature and local governance.

One thing I hope to do with this app in particular is to show the racialized nature of prison gerrymandering - as Michelle Alexander writes in *The New Jim Crow*, the prison-industrial complex in 2017 operates remarkably similarly to Jim Crow-era policies, including the counting of slaves as 3/5ths of a person when districting for votes.

     - talks about the Supreme Court case Evenwel v. Abbott (2016) which ruled states may count all residents, even if they are ineligible to vote, in drawing districts, as an interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment's "One Person, One Vote"
      - The case did not mention prisoners in its' main brief, which Liptak, the *Times*'s Supreme Court correspondent is commenting on in this article.
      - Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU's voting rights project clarifies that prisoners convicted of felonies should be counted in drawing districts, but where they *used* to live. (https://journals.law.stanford.edu/stanford-law-policy-review/print/volume-22/issue-2-prison-policy/captive-constituents-prison-based-gerrymandering-and-current)
              -as Mr.Ho notes, prison gerrymandering is key precisely because the total incarcerated population of the US would be the "37th-largest state and would be larger than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont and Alaska combined.”

      - Article looks at Cranston, Rhode Island, where a prison significantly skewed how an area of the city, the Sixth Ward, was represented.
      - “their numerical presence in the Ward is unfairly inflating the voice of the Ward’s other inhabitants,” Lagueux wrote.
      - the administration of Cranston argues that this decision goes against the *Evenwel* decision, however, as clarified by
"Brenda Wright, an attorney with the public policy group Demos — which backed the lawsuit along with the Prison Policy Initiative — said the the litigation was aimed at getting localities to account for prisoners where it truly counts."

## Inspirations and prior work

- map-based works, to create a map of inflow and outflow of populations caused by prison gerrymandering. Inspired by maps like ![Map from Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/images/ohiocountieschange.png)
    - also overlay data about black/Hispanic populations in the rest of the counties


- Live map at *Electionland*
       - https://projects.propublica.org/electionland/
       - I really like how they use different colors to represent different issues happening in different states. I'm thinking that I want to have a large map that pictures the inflow and outflow from each county due to prison gerrymandering, and also highlight counties that have decided to put legislation against prison gerrymandering.


- ProPublica's map of Racial Disparities in Car Insurance Premiums
     -http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/carinsurance
     - the way in which they outline the districts that are minority-majority; but show through the heatmap where the biggest differentials in car insurance premiums are, but also have the bar chart on the right side of the screen is a really effective means of communicating multiple ideas.

- Prison Policy Initiative's online web app
        - I want to do something similar to this (https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/toobig/datasearch.php?field=Per_Inc&operator=LIKE&q=&Submit=Search&field1=&operator1=&q1=&sortby=&sortorder=) but with a nationwide view in addition to a searchable app.
